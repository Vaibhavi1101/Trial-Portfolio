Tailwind CSS Bootcamp by Devtown Project

During this Bootcamp I was introduced to a great tool for front-end Web Development - Which is Tailwind CSS.
It is a good tool and can be used along with the HTML file itself, which is quite handy for many. This bootcamp covered good basics of Tailwind CSS, and helped me understand the diiference between plain CSS, expanding my knowledge in this field, and I'm thankful for the opportunity, along with the project given which was a good practice for all the conncepts we were introduced too.
I've always liked to work on such projects, front-end, creating attractive web pages, and this was a nice experience with something new.
I liked attending the bootcamp as well as the project.

Note : This is just a trial website made for practice and project. The buttons are solely for front-end design application and UI, so they don't really work.
